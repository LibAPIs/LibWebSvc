# LibWebSvc

A collection of utilities for easily embedding a Jetty web server into your application.

## Auth Lists

Auth lists may be defined in the `auth` directory relative to the project root. Each list shall be named `{realm}.conf` where the realm can be user configurable for different access control groups.

Entries for authlists may be generated by appending each user to a newline, as a `{user}:{sha256}` string, where the user password is SHA-256 encoded.

A helper method has been included to generate these entires. It may be invoked with the following command:

```
java -cp myapp.jar com.mclarkdev.tools.libwebsvc.LibWebSvcAuthGenerator {user} {pass}
```
