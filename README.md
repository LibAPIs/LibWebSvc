# LibWebSvc

A collection of tools for easily starting a Jetty server embedded within your application.

### Maven Dependency

Include the library in your project by adding the following dependency to your pom.xml

```
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.mclarkdev.tools</groupId>
	<artifactId>libwebsvc</artifactId>
	<version>1.5.1</version>
</dependency>
```

## Example

### API Handlers

Individual API handlers may be created by implementing LibWebSvcAPI.

The implemented class can then be passed to the server at creation time.

```
LibWebSvc webServer = new LibWebSvc(bindAddr, bindPort);
webServer.addHandler("/command", MyRestHandler.class);
webServer.start();
```

### WebSocket Handlers

Individual Websocket handlers may be created by implemeting LibWebSvcWS.

The implemented class can then be passed to the server at creation time.

```
LibWebSvc webServer = new LibWebSvc(bindAddr, bindPort);
webServer.addWSHandler("/socket", MyWebsocketHandler.class);
webServer.start();
```

### Static Resources

Static resources my be served by providing a _resources_ directory containing the web app.

```
LibWebSvc webServer = new LibWebSvc(bindAddr, bindPort);
webServer.addResources(86400);
webServer.start();
```

### Auth Lists

Auth lists may be defined in the `auth` directory relative to the project root. Each list shall be named `{realm}.conf` where the realm can be user configurable for different access control groups.

Entries for authlists may be generated by appending each user to a newline, as a `{user}:{sha256}` string, where the user password is SHA-256 encoded.

A helper method has been included to generate these entires. It may be invoked with the following command:

```
java -cp myapp.jar com.mclarkdev.tools.libwebsvc.LibWebSvcAuthGenerator {user} {pass}
```
